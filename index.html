  <h2>Superconductivity이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity" target="_blank">Superconductivity</a> is the set of physical properties observed in certain materials, wherein <strong><u>electrical resistance vanishes</u> and from which <u>magnetic flux fields are expelled.</u></strong> Any material exhibiting these properties is a superconductor.
  <br><br>Unlike an ordinary metallic conductor, whose resistance decreases gradually as its temperature is lowered even down to near absolute zero, a superconductor has a characteristic critical temperature below which the resistance drops abruptly to zero. An electric current through a loop of superconducting wire can persist indefinitely with no power source.

  <p>This phenomenon was discovered by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes on April 8, 1911, in Leiden.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">Like ferromagnetism and atomic spectral lines, superconductivity is a quantum mechanical mystery. It is characterized by the Meissner effect, the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor during its transitions into the superconducting state. The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of perfect conductivity in classical physics.</p>
